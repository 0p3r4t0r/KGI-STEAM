# KGI STEAM

The name is a combination of an abbreviation for Kogakuin 
(the school where I used to work) and the 
acronym [STEAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEAM_fields).




## Features
The site is designed to allow students to practice solving problems. It requires no login,
so students don't have to remember another set of login credentials.

### For students
* Try a problem and check it instantly.
* Randomize the numbers in your problems and try again.

### For teachers
* Use the syllabus to remind students what's going on in class.
* Worksheets allow you to render mathematical equations on the web.
* Resources allow students to quickly navigate to any external links you may need for class.
