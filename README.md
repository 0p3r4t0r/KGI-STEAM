# KGI STEAM

The name is a combination of an abbreviation for Keyless Grading Interface and the education
acronym [STEAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEAM_fields).


## Keyless Grading Interface
The site is designed to allow students to practice solving problems. It requires no login,
so students don't have to remember another set of login credentials.
The site also creates worksheets that can be printed off.
